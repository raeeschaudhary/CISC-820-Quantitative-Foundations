Instruction to Run Step-wise Code.

1. Download and extract the folder on your machine.
2. Open the folder directory in Matlab 
3. Open the Command window
4. Run: [features, Ground_truth]= Load_data_Trainingset()
5. Run: Z = Z_formation(features)
6. Run: Weights = Linear_Regression(Z, Ground_truth)
7. Run: MSE = Mean_Squared_Error(Weights, Z, Ground_truth)
8. Run: [Train_Error, Test_Error] = Kfold_CrossValidation(features, Ground_truth, 5)
9. Run: Features_engineering(features, Ground_truth, 5)
10. Run: Labels = Curve_fitting()
11. Get all labels in the output.txt file

That's it.
